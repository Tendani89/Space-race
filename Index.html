<p>The Space Race was a contest between the United States and the Soviet Union to explore space. It began in the 1950s. Both countries wanted to be the first to do big things in space, like sending satellites and people. The Soviet Union sent the first satellite and the first person into space. Later, the United States was the first to land people on the Moon. The Space Race helped us learn a lot about space.</p>
